In light of the recent lawsuit filed by New York City against the architects of the Queens Public Library for non-compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), the importance of ensuring accessibility in public buildings has been thrust into the spotlight. This incident not only highlights the need for stringent adherence to compliance standards but also the potential repercussions of oversight. In this post, we’ll delve into the details of the lawsuit, explore the implications for the architecture and construction industry, and introduce how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multimodal capabilities can be a game-changer in preventing such costly oversights.

### **What Happened**

New York City has taken legal action against the architects of the Queens Public Library at Hunters Point for designing a building that is not fully accessible to people with disabilities. The lawsuit points out several design flaws, including inaccessible areas due to staircases and insufficient wheelchair space in bathrooms. The city estimates a staggering $10 million cost to rectify these issues and bring the building up to compliance standards. This situation underscores the critical need for compliance checks throughout the design and construction process.

### **What’s Happening Now**

As the legal proceedings continue, the architecture and construction industries are closely monitoring the outcome of this case. It serves as a cautionary tale and a reminder of the legal and financial consequences of non-compliance with accessibility laws.

### **What This Means For You**

For professionals in the design and construction sectors, this lawsuit is a stark reminder of the importance of compliance with federal, state, and local accessibility laws. It emphasizes the need for tools and methodologies that can assist in ensuring that designs meet all necessary standards before construction begins.

### **What You Can Do Now**

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multimodal capabilities presents a proactive approach to compliance. By integrating RAG into the design process, architects and designers can leverage a system that retrieves relevant documents, guidelines, and images to check against their designs in real-time. This technology can significantly reduce the risk of oversight and non-compliance, potentially saving millions in retrofitting costs and legal fees.

The Queens Public Library lawsuit is a wake-up call for the industry to adopt more rigorous compliance checks within the design process. Retrieval-augmented generation with multimodal capabilities could be the key to ensuring that such costly oversights are avoided in the future.
